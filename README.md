Tibia High Resolution Timer is a modification for old versions of Tibia Clients that allow to use them without problems on certain systems that encounter problems due to poorly maded timer system in Tibia.
To use it just copy "winmm.dll" to the client you use, you can download release or compile source yourself.

## Videos of the problem:
[Without High Resolution Timer:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ov46NCXEdqQ "Without High Resolution Timer")
As you can see even though there's 800+ fps the client has very unstable frametimes.

[With High Resolution Timer:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yf4BlKUHdII "With High Resolution Timer")
As you can see the client has now stable frametimes.
